  - name: "First Generation (WD22)"
    start_year: 2000

    description: "The original Nissan Xterra was introduced as a rugged, affordable SUV positioned below the Pathfinder in Nissan's lineup, targeting younger, active buyers seeking off-road capability without luxury pretensions. Built on the Frontier pickup truck platform, it featured distinctive styling with a raised rear roofline, externally mounted first aid kit, and prominent roof rack with integrated storage box. Initially powered by either a 2.4L four-cylinder (143 hp) or a 3.3L V6 (170 hp, later increased to 180 hp), paired with either a five-speed manual or four-speed automatic transmission. Available in rear-wheel drive or part-time four-wheel drive configurations with a two-speed transfer case for low-range off-road capability. The interior emphasized durability and functionality over luxury, with wash-out flooring, stadium-style rear seating for improved visibility, and numerous storage solutions for outdoor gear. Trim levels included the base XE and more feature-rich SE, with later additions including the rugged SE Supercharged featuring a supercharged version of the 3.3L V6 producing 210 horsepower. The first-generation Xterra established a distinctive niche in the SUV market, appealing to outdoor enthusiasts with its combination of authentic off-road capability, practical design features, and value pricing."

  - name: "Second Generation (N50)"
    start_year: 2005
    end_year: 2015
    description: "The second-generation Xterra featured more aggressive styling with a muscular stance, distinctive stepped roofline, and pronounced fender flares. Built on Nissan's F-Alpha platform shared with the Frontier and Titan, it grew larger and more capable than its predecessor. Powered exclusively by a 4.0L V6 engine producing 265 horsepower (later revised to 261 hp), paired with either a six-speed manual or five-speed automatic transmission. Available in rear-wheel drive or part-time four-wheel drive configurations with a two-speed transfer case and available electronic locking rear differential on off-road-oriented models. The chassis featured a fully boxed ladder frame, independent front suspension, and solid rear axle with leaf springs optimized for off-road durability. The interior maintained its focus on functionality with easy-clean surfaces, adjustable cargo organization system, and available built-in first-aid kit. Trim levels evolved throughout the generation but typically included the base X, volume-selling S, luxury-oriented SE, and off-road-focused Pro-4X (initially called Off Road), the latter featuring Bilstein shocks, skid plates, all-terrain tires, and additional off-road equipment. A refresh in 2009 brought updated styling, refined interior, and additional features. Despite minimal changes in its later years, the second-generation Xterra maintained a loyal following among off-road enthusiasts seeking a legitimate SUV with true off-road capabilities in an era of increasingly car-based crossovers. Production ended in 2015 as Nissan consolidated its SUV lineup and stringent emissions and safety standards made updating the platform financially challenging."
